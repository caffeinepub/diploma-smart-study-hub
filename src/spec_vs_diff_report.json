  "summary": "The diff implements most requirements for PhonePe QR code payment integration. REQ-27 (QR code display), REQ-28 (storing phone number), and REQ-30 (payment confirmation with phone number) are fully implemented. REQ-29 (payment instructions) is partially implemented but missing explicit mentions of Google Pay and Paytm as compatible payment apps, though it includes PhonePe and step-by-step instructions.",

      "requirement": "Instructions must mention PhonePe, Google Pay, and Paytm as compatible payment apps",
      "reason": "The SubscriptionPage.tsx shows payment instructions with PhonePe QR code, but the visible truncated content does not explicitly mention Google Pay and Paytm alongside PhonePe in the instructions",
