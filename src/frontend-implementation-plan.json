Instead of showing the full UPI ID '9392412728-2@axl', display only partial digits (e.g., '93924*****@axl' or '****2728@axl'). Ensure the QR code and deep link functionality remain unchanged and still use the complete UPI ID internally. The masking should be applied only to the text display visible to users, not to the payment processing logic."

The hook should continue to use the full UPI ID from the backend for payment processing, while any display or logging of the UPI ID should use a masked version if exposed to the user."
